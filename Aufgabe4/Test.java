    * ******* SquirrelFood *******
    * SquirrelFood can't be a subtype of any other types because it is the supertype
    * of every single other type implemented in this assignment.

    /*
    * ******* VegetarianSquirrelFood *******
    *
    * We don't have much details about this type but what we know is that
    * VegetarianSquirrelFood is food which is vegetarian and which is eaten
    * by squirrels because non-vegetarian food may not be durable enough.
    * We don't know whether vegetarian food is always durable or not, which
    * means that we can't tag it to 'durable' or 'perishable'.
    * But VegetarianSquirrelFood is by all means a SquirrelFood because each
    * elements are equal in both types.

    /*
    * ******* PerishableSquirrelFood / DurableSquirrelFood *******
    * PerishableSquirrelFood is not a DurableSquirrelFood because it does not need a bury value and
    * eatWithinDays() is not dependent upon another value (bury)
    * ----> DurableSquirrelFood is also not a PerishableSquirrelFood because of same reason.
    *
    * PerishableSquirrelFood and DurableSquirrelFood are also not a Fruit because a Fruit has the
    * fromMonth() and toMonth() values which represent when these types of food can be found.
    * The types PerishableSquirrelFood and DurableSquirrelFood don't need these values so they
    * can't be a subclass of Fruit.
    *
    * PerishableSquirrelFood and DurableSquirrelFood are also not a Cone because a Cone has the method
    * seams which returns the number of seams within this cone which is not required (and would be very wrong)
    * for PerishableSquirrelFood and DurableSquirrelFood
    *
     */

    /*
    * ******* Nut / Fruit / Cone *******
    * Nuts are not Fruits because Fruits have the values fromMonth() and toMonth() which
    * are not needed by Nuts and would be wrong. So Nut is not a subtype of Fruit.
    *
    * Nut is also not a subtype of PerishableSquirrelFood because eatWithinDays() within
    * PerishableSquirrelFood is not dependent upon the value bury, which Fruits depend upon due to
    * the fact that they are subtypes of DurableSquirrelFood
    *
    * Fruit is not a Nut for the same exact reason.
    *
    * FreshFruit is a PerishableSquirrelFood and can therefore not be a DurableSquirrelFood because that
    * would mean eatWithinDays() must be dependent from the value bury but this is wrong for
    * PerishableSquirrelFood.
    *
    * DryFruit is not a PerishableSquirrelFood because eatWithinDays() must be dependent upon bury and
    * PerishableSquirrelFood disallows that indirectly.
    *
    * Cones are not Fruits because Fruits have the values fromMonth() and toMonth() which
    * are not needed by Cones and would be wrong. So Cone is not a subtype of Fruit.
    *
    * Cone is also not a subtype of Nut because bury must be false for a Cone and true for a Nut which
    * makes them incompatible.
